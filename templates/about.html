                    <p>
                        My name is <b>Chris Valente</b>, a junior Computer Science major at Ramapo College, who also minors in Data Science. I love all things sports and technology, and am also extremely passionate about writing and music.
                        I am facinated by the concept of creating things, and am the kind of person who would rather spend hours to automate a simple task than to actually do the task itself; for better or for worse.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In that facet, I've worked on a lot of scripts ranging in size and complexity from using web-scraping to compile a daily schedule of relevant sporting events, to implementing song recognition API to
                        change my lights to the colors of the album cover of a song it hears. In terms of larger projects, my favorite I've done so far is called babyGENIUS, a desktop app that mimics a removed feature from the GENIUS phone app, which
                        could fetch lyrics of any song that it notices when you're currently listening to one on your phone. babyGENIUS connects to a users Spotify and mimics that concept, as well as having extended search and playback functionality.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In regard to my classwork so far as a student, I've taken many relevant classes, such as <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Software Design</strong>, <strong>Data Analytics</strong>, 
                        and <strong>Data Structures</strong>,
                        as well as being trained and well equipped with knowledge on industry standard tools like Git, VSCode, testing suites, and more. During the semesters, I am a Computer Science/Data Science tutor at Ramapo College,
                        where I assist fellow STEM students with programming concepts and implementation in C++, Python, and R. <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the last year, I have become very passionate about the research aspect of my two educational fields, and have led and contributed to many research projects since. These projects range from a large exploratory analysis report into the Tinder profiles, and how users interact with the platform, to fitting and running 
                        logistic regression models to predict outcomes such as the likelyhood of songs being popular, or couples getting divorced.
