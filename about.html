                    <p>
                        My name is Chris Valente, a junior Computer Science major at Ramapo College, who also minors in Data Science. I love all things sports and technology, and am also extremely passionate about my other two main hobbies; writing and music.
                        I am obsessed with the concept of creating things, and am the kind of person who would rather spend hours to automate a simple task than to do the task itself; for better or for worse.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In that facet, I've worked on a lot of projects ranging in size and complexity from using web-scraping to compile a daily schedule of relevant sporting events, to implementing song recognition APIs to
                        change my lights to match the colors of the album cover of a song it hears. In terms of larger projects, my favorite I've created so far is babyGENIUS, a desktop app that mimics a removed feature from the GENIUS phone app, which
                        could detect and fetch lyrics of any song that you're currently listening to on your phone. babyGENIUS connects to the users Spotify and mimics that functionality, as well as having the option to search for songs and queuing them to be played
                        on your main device.
                        <br><br>
                        I am currently working on a proof of concept web app that I call 'Hey', which is intended to be a social platform for language learners to
                        connect based on native language and target language in spirit very similar to Tinder, where users can right and left swipe on appealing profiles. The frontend for this is being
                        written in React, and the backend uses Express. I hope to have a more finished version to put on display soon!<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my semesters as a student, I've taken many relevant courses where I learned a wide range of fundamentals, such as data structures, operating systems, how to manipulate and visualize data,
                        as well as being trained and well equipped with knowledge on industry standard tools like Git, VSCode, testing suites, and more. I am currently a CS/DS tutor at Ramapo College during the school year
                        where I assist STEM students with programming concepts and implementation<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am also very interested in technology from a research perspective, most recently given presentations on research I have done regarding the role of technology in sports (specifically in how it affects the players, the fans, and
                        how it changes the game analytically). I have also worked on regression models as a part of a report with the goal of understanding and predicting what
                        songs are likely to chart the billboards and why, and have just finished working on another report that observed the findings made on an extrapolation and analysis of a sample of local male vs female Tinder profiles.
