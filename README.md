# cval.io

## What is it?

- [cval.io](https://cval.io) is my first foray into the "personal project via the means of a resume/portfolio site" space

- first time truly working with the simple JS/CSS/HTML combination to create an animated webpage

- inspired by `Wordle` and all the other `Wordle` clones out there; decided to create a `Wordle` themed personal webpage after working on making one of those clones myself

## TODO

- port to flask
  - look at using python variables in the html; passing arguments through the render_template

- Slight page animations when going from page to page
  - <https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-page-transitions/> number 6

- Fix the font problem on non Mac devices

- Fix the mobile version stretching and unintended formatting
