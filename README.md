# cval.io (WIP)

## What is it?
- [cval.io](https://cval.io) is my first foray into the "personal project via the means of a resume/portfolio site" space

- first time truly working with the simple JS/CSS/HTML combination to create an animated webpage

- inspired by `Wordle` and all the other `Wordle` clones out there; decided to create a `Wordle` themed personal webpage after working on making one of those clones myself

## TODO:

- <del>Add hover animations for word grids</del>

- <del>Add hook to Valdle game if user hits enter 5 times (tell visitor on about page)</del>

- <del>Add `About` page, consisting of school stuff and projects; the true portfolio aspect<del>

- Add `Contact` page (not sure what this should exactly consist of yet)

- Slight page animations when going from page to page

- Fix the bugs on Valdle and make it actually playable
