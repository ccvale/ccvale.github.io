                        My name is Chris Valente, a third year Computer Science major at Ramapo College, who is also minoring in Data Science. I love all things sports and technology, and am also extremely passionate about my two main hobbies; writing and music. I am obsessed with the concept of creating things,
                        and am the kind of person who would rather spend hours to automate a simple task than to do the task itself; for better or for worse.<br><br>

                        In that facet, I've written a lot of fun scripts ranging in complexity from using web-scraping to compile a daily schedule of relevant sporting events, to implementing song recognition APIs to
                        change my lights to match the colors of the album cover of a song it hears. In terms of larger projects, my favorite I've created so far is babyGENIUS, a desktop app that mimics a removed feature from the GENIUS phone app, which
                        could detect and fetch lyrics of any song that you're currently listening to on your phone. babyGENIUS connects to the users Spotify and mimics that functionality, as well as having the option to search for songs and queuing them to be played on any device
                        you're currently using Spotify.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my semesters as a student, I've taken many relevant courses where I learned a wide range of fundamentals, such as data structures, how to manipulate and visualize data in Python and R
                        using many of their key libraries, as well as being trained and well equipped with knowledge on industry standard tools like Git, VSCode, testing suites, and more.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have most recently given presentations on research I have done regarding the role of technology in sports (specifically in how it affects the players, the fans, and
                        how it changes the game analytically). I have worked on regression models as a part of a final project with the goal of understanding and predicting what
                        songs are likely to chart the billboards and why, and am currently working on a report that is observing the findings made on an extrapolation and analysis of a sample of local male vs female Tinder profiles.
