                    <p>
                        My name is <b>Chris Valente</b>, a junior Computer Science major at Ramapo College, who also minors in Data Science. I love all things sports and technology, and am also extremely passionate about writing and music.
                        I am facinated by the concept of creating things, and am the kind of person who would rather spend hours to automate a simple task than to actually do the task itself; for better or for worse.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In that facet, I've worked on a lot of scripts ranging in size and complexity from using web-scraping to compile a daily schedule of relevant sporting events, to implementing a song recognition API to
                        change my lights to match the colors of the album cover of a song it hears. In terms of larger projects, my favorite I've created so far is babyGENIUS, a desktop app that mimics a removed feature from the GENIUS phone app, which
                        could detect and fetch lyrics of any song that you're currently listening to on your phone. babyGENIUS connects to the users Spotify and mimics that functionality, as well as having the option to search for songs and queuing them to be played
                        on your main device.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In regard to my classwork so far as a student, I've taken many relevant classes where I've learned a wide range of fundamentals, such as <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Software Design</strong>, <strong>Data Analytics</strong>, 
                        and <strong>Data Structures</strong>,
                        as well as being trained and well equipped with knowledge on industry standard tools like Git, VSCode, testing suites, and more. During the semesters, I am a Computer Science/Data Science tutor at Ramapo College,
                        where I assist fellow STEM students with programming concepts and implementation in C++, Python, and R. <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the last year, I have become very passionate about the research aspect of my two educational fields, and have led and contributed to many research projects in that time. These projects range from an exploratory analysis research into Tinder profiles, and how users interact with the platform, to fitting and running models to
                        predict the likelihood of a song making its way to the top charts, and even to running an analysis on a dataset of married/previously married couples who have answered a set of questions, with the goal of being able to predict if the couple is married or divorced.
