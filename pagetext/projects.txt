Before quarantine started, I chose to major in Computer Science, but I didn't have an extremely strong background in programming at the time.
In the time since, I've dedicated a lot of my time to learning Python, which is currently my language of choice. Though I've handled other languages in school,
and through personal curiosity, I feel comfortable saying that I'm fluent in Python. 
I've spent a lot of time working on different small projects in order to practice my skills, and will showcase some of those here.

My favorite project is babyGENIUS,
which was inspired the 'Genius' app (pretty much a lyrics database). The app had a feature that it retired a couple years ago which detected if you were listening to
music on your phone, and brought you a page with lyrics of that song. Since I often find myself looking for song lyrics, I wanted to recreate that feature for my desktop.
The program detects if the user is listening to a song on Spotify. It will tell you what song you're listening to, and can get you the lyrics to that song.
You can also use it to search for a song, and it will give those lyrics as well. I also have the program set up to search for the album artwork of the song
in question, and if you have HUE lights set up, the lights will change to a color palatte matching the artwork. The code is a bit messy, and it doesn't work 100% perfectly,
but I'm particularly proud of this program.
