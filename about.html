                    <p>
                        My name is <b>Chris Valente</b>, a senior Computer Science major at Ramapo College, also minoring in Data Science. I love all
                        things sports and technology, and am also extremely passionate about other hobbies, like writing and music. I am
                        fascinated by the concept of creating things, and am the kind of person who would rather spend hours to automate a task
                        than to do the task itself; for better or for worse. <br><br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In that facet, I've written countless scripts ranging in scale and complexity, from automating a web-scraper to send me
                        a daily schedule of interesting events, to implementing song recognition API to manipulate my lights to match the colors
                        of the album of a song it hears. In terms of larger projects, I am currently working on the proof of concept for a
                        platform called <b>disconnect</b>; a right/left swiping friendship matchmaker for the online community. It will allow Discord
                        users to log in with their credentials and swipe (and potentially match with) on other created profiles purely based on
                        interests and personality.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My biggest interest at the moment is in working with raw data, and turning it into a story that explains a narrative. I
                        have become extremely facinated with the Data Science field, and really enjoy working on research projects, in which I have worked on a
                        few, ranging in topic and scale. To name a few interesting ones, I have led a group on a report that implemented Machine Learning algorithms 
                        with the goal of testing and engineering models to most accurately predict the marital status of a couple based on their responses to a study, and have led a group on a report that
                        studied how Tinder users interact with the platform, based on data I engineered. (Not the flashiest, but it was definitely the most fun.)
