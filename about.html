                        My name is Chris Valente, a third year Computer Science major at Ramapo College, who is also minoring in Data Science, with a 3.65 GPA. I love all things sports and technology, and am also extremely passionate about my two main hobbies; writing and music. I am obsessed with the concept of creating things,
                        and am the kind of person who would rather spend hours to automate a simple task than to do the task itself.<br><br>

                        In that facet, I've written a lot of fun scripts ranging in complexity from using web scraping to compile a daily schedule of relevant sporting events, to implementing song recognition APIs to
                        change the color of my room lights to match the colors of the album cover of a song it hears me currently playing. In terms of larger projects, my favorite project I've created so far is called babyGENIUS, a desktop application that mimics a removed feature from the GENIUS phone app, which
                        quickly detected and fetched lyrics of a song that you're currently listening to on your phone. My version connects to your Spotify account and can detect a song you're currently playing and get the corresponding lyrics, as well as having the option to search independently for songs and queuing them to be played on whichever device
                        you're currently using Spotify.<br><br>

                        I'm currently searching for an internship because I feel like I've reached a point as a student where I know that I will be able to learn so much more in an
                        environment where I can observe and learn from true professionals going about their craft. I am absolutely confident that I can contribute to whatever internship
                        team or group you, the reader of this page, are recruiting for, and it is my number one priority to do so.<br><br>
